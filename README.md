# Multinertial: Multiple IMU Sensor Fusion

This repository contains the embedded software portion of the multinertial project, which
is ment to act as a test bed for fun new ways to do intertial positioning by utlizing multiple
IMU units.

The target is the ESP32C3 on an ESP DevkitM1 board. Building this project requires the ESP-IDF
from Espressif.
